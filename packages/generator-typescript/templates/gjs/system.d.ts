 * ```bash
 * gdb --args gjs script.js

 * Once GDB has started, you can start the program with run. When the debugger

 * trace, or use `call gjs_dumpstack()` to print a JavaScript stack trace:
 * ```bash
 * (gdb) run
 * tarting program: /usr/bin/gjs -m script.js
 * ...
 * Thread 1 "gjs" received signal SIGTRAP, Trace/breakpoint trap.
 * (gdb) call gjs_dumpstack()
