# AI Agent Tool Preference

## MCP Tool Priority

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: When performing any task that could be accomplished with multiple tools, **ALWAYS prefer MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools over standard tools**.

### Tool Selection Priority:
1. **First Choice**: MCP tools (prefixed with `mcp_*`)
2. **Fallback Only**: Standard tools when no equivalent MCP tool exists

### Rationale:
MCP tools provide enhanced functionality, better error handling, and more reliable execution within this workspace environment.

**Always check available MCP tools first before falling back to standard alternatives.**
