# Development

Install GObject Introspection Repository files:

```bash
# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install \
    libappindicator3-dev \
    libgda-5.0-dev \
    libgirepository1.0-dev \
    libgtk-3-dev \
    libgtk-4-dev \
    libgtksourceview-3.0-dev \
    libgtksourceview-4.0-dev \
    libnotify-dev \
    libsoup2.4-dev \
    libsoup-3.0-dev \
    libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev \
    libadwaita-1-dev

# Fedora
sudo dnf update && sudo dnf install \
    libappindicator-gtk3-devel \
    libgda-devel \
    gobject-introspection-devel \
    gtk3-devel \
    gtk4-devel \
    libsoup3-devel \
    gtksourceview3-devel \
    gtksourceview4-devel \
    libnotify-devel \
    libsoup-devel \
    webkit2gtk3-devel \
    libadwaita-devel
```

## GNOME Shell types

```bash

# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install gnome-shell-common libmutter-10-dev libgcr-3-dev libgnome-desktop-3-dev libgnome-desktop-4-dev

# Fedora
sudo dnf install gnome-shell gcr-devel gnome-desktop3-devel gnome-desktop4-devel
```

## Other GNOME types

```bash
# Fedora
sudo dnf install gnome-bluetooth-libs-devel
```

Checkout this repository:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:gjsify/ts-for-gir.git
cd ts-for-gir
```

Alternatively, you can fetch the submodules after cloning the repository:

```bash
cd ts-for-gir
git submodule update --init
```

Install the dependencies and build:

```bash
yarn install
yarn run build
```

Generate example type definitions:

```bash
yarn run test:girs:gjs:gtk4
```

## Gir XML Format

See [gobject-introspection/docs/gir-1.2.rnc](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gobject-introspection/-/blob/master/docs/gir-1.2.rnc) for type definitions.

## Debugging

It is strongly recommended to use the debugger. For Visual Studio Code there are some predefined launch configurations for it.
The VSCode launch.json configuration is intended that Node was installed via [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and yarn was installed globally using npm.

Take a look at the following video, to see how the debugging process looks like:

## Yarn

We are using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and its [workspace feature](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces).
Yarn serves as a replacement for NPM, just like with NPM, you can run the scripts in the `package.json`.
We have created some of them for development.

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

### Validate

To validate all your generated type definition files in this project run 

```bash
yarn run validate:types:all
```

To validate only your type definition files for GJS

```bash
yarn run validate:types:gjs
```

To validate only your type definition files for node-gtk

```bash
yarn run validate:types:node
```

You can also validate a single type definition file like this

```bash
yarn run validate -- ./@types/gobject-2.0.d.ts
```

## Test

### Test gir files

We have a test which tries to generate the type definition files for all gir files from the [vala-girs](https://github.com/nemequ/vala-girs) repository.

Before you can run this test you need to checkout the vala-girs submodule, to do that run this in the root of ts-for-gir:

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

Now you can run the test with

```bash
yarn run test:girs:gjs
yarn run test:girs:node
# or yarn run test:girs:all
```

# FAQ

Problem: I get the following error:

```
FATAL ERROR: Scavenger: semi-space copy Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory
```

Solution:

```bash
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=25600 yarn run ...
```
