`ts-for-gir` is a robust [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) type definitions generator that improves the development experience of [GJS](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Gjs) projects. It has been completely rewritten over time to provide a more complete and accurate TypeScript representation of the [GObject
introspection](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GObjectIntrospection) interfaces. With `ts-for-gir`, developers can now benefit from TypeScript's strong typing and improved code navigation, making it easier to build robust and powerful applications with GJS.

## Getting Started

Install the latest LTS version of Node.js. We recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for this purpose. After Node.js has been installed, `ts-for-gir` can be executed with the following command:

```bash
npx @ts-for-gir/cli --help
```

That's it, you can start generating your types üë©‚Äçüíª‚òï
