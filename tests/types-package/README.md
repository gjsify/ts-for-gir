# `@ts-for-gir-test/types-packages`

contains several gir types of different packages, also types for the same library but in different versions, e.g.: Gtk3 and Gtk4 to test if this leads to conflicts between the generated types.

## TODO

Generate the `packages.json` and `types.ts` so that all existing types are used?
