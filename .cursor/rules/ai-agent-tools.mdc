# AI Agent Tool Preference

## MCP Tool Priority

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: When performing any task that could be accomplished with multiple tools, **ALWAYS prefer MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools over standard tools**.

### Tool Selection Priority:
1. **First Choice**: MCP tools (prefixed with `mcp_*`)
2. **Fallback Only**: Standard tools when no equivalent MCP tool exists

### Rationale:
MCP tools provide enhanced functionality, better error handling, and more reliable execution within this workspace environment.

**Always check available MCP tools first before falling back to standard alternatives.**

## Terminal Command Guidelines

When using terminal/command execution tools, **always append `| cat` to commands** to ensure AI agents can read the output properly.

### Examples:
- `git log --oneline -10 | cat` (instead of `git log --oneline -10`)
- `yarn check | cat` (instead of `yarn check`)
- `ls -la | cat` (instead of `ls -la`)

### Rationale:
Some terminal commands use pagers or special output formatting that may not be readable by AI agents. Adding `| cat` ensures the output is displayed in plain text format that can be properly processed.
